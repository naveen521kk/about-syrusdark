      <h1>About Syrusdark</h1>
      <p>
        So what is this thing Syrusdark, that should be the question, if you've
        come to this page. Syrusdark is an alias of
        <a href="https://www.naveenmk.me">mine</a>, which I use for my social
        media accounts, as well as other things. Though I've changed my alias
        mostly to <code>naveen521kk</code> on most platforms, I still use
        Syrusdark for a few things like Discord, and some other platforms. I
        also own the domain
        <a href="https://syrusdark.website">syrusdark.website</a>, where you're
        currently on (probably on a subdomain but well).
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this alias, Syrusdark, by copying my friend Sai's gamer tag.
        His is
        <code>syrus_dhark</code> and I just removed the <code>h</code> there as
        well as the underscore. Well, there's nothing special than that ðŸ™ƒ.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mainly use the domain syrusdark.website to host my projects. I use
        this rather than my other domain naveenmk.me, because I don't want my
        name to be in the URL of those projects. I also host my old blog on this
        domain,
        <a href="https://blog.syrusdark.website">see my blog here.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have an email address, <code>naveen@syrusdark.website</code>,
        from this domain, so you can also contact me there ðŸ˜‰.
