      <h1>About Syrusdark</h1>
      <p>
        Ah, Syrusdark. The alias that I, the illustrious 😎
        <a href="https://www.naveenmk.me">Naveen</a>, use for my social media
        accounts and various online activities. Sure, I've mostly retired the
        name in favor of <code>naveen521kk</code>, but there are still a few
        platforms where Syrusdark reigns supreme. Plus, I own the domain
        <a href="https://syrusdark.website">syrusdark.website</a>, which is
        where you currently find yourself (probably on a subdomain, but let's
        not get too technical 🤓).
      </p>
      <p>
        So how did I come up with the name Syrusdark, you ask? Well, I'll let
        you in on a little secret: I totally ripped off my friend Sai's gamer
        tag, <code>syrus_dhark</code>, and removed the "h" and underscore.
        Voila! Instant brand identity.🙃
      </p>
      <p>
        As for why I use syrusdark.website to host my projects, it's simple: I
        don't want my name all up in the URL. That's just asking for trouble 🙅‍♂️.
        And speaking of projects, you can also find my old blog at
        <a href="https://blog.syrusdark.website">blog.syrusdark.website</a>, if
        you're feeling nostalgic (or just want to see how terrible my writing
        was in the early days 😬).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're dying to get in touch with me (and I know you are), you can
        reach me at <code>naveen@syrusdark.website</code> 📧. But please, keep
        it professional. I have a strict policy against spam 🚫, cat memes 🐱,
        and anything else that might make me question my life choices 🤔.
